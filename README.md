# Hi, I'm Abdul Wahab Malik

AI Engineer and Backend Developer based in Lahore, Pakistan.
I build production-grade systems combining Computer Vision, backend engineering, and distributed microservices. My work spans real-time video analytics, API integrations, and automation pipelines using FastAPI, Temporal, and cloud technologies.
